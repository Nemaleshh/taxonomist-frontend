## üìú Model Overview  
The Taxonomist model is based on an **agentic approach**, dynamically linking tax policies, economic behavior, and socio-economic outcomes. The system simulates different agents, including **households, corporations, governments, and external sectors**, to predict GDP and policy effectiveness.
